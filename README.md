Developed an IoT-based Efficient Waste Collection System with Smart Bins for optimized waste management.Utilized smart bins with sensors for real-time monitoring, promoting efficient collection scheduling and route optimization.Integrated IoT technology, Firebase, and servo motors, achieving reduced operational costs, enhanced sustainability, and improved waste management practices.

Real-time Uses and Applications:
  - Enables real-time monitoring of waste levels, optimizing collection routes and schedules for efficient waste management.
  - Enhances data-driven decision-making, contributing to cost savings, reduced environmental impact, and sustainable waste practices.

Workspace Setup:Requires Raspberry Pi with GPIO configurations, sensors, and servo motors. Firebase account for database management. Python script for data processing and IoT implementation.

Benefits of Real-time Implementation:
  - Real-time monitoring reduces overflow instances, optimizes collection routes, and minimizes operational costs.
  - Data-driven insights improve waste management decision-making, contributing to resource efficiency and sustainability.
  - Proactive maintenance ensures timely bin servicing, preventing littering and promoting a cleaner environment.
  - User engagement through additional features like mobile apps fosters responsible waste disposal and community satisfaction.
